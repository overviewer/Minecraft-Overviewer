# General note about pasting transparent image objects onto an image with an
# alpha channel:
# If you use the image as its own mask, it will work fine only if the alpha
# channel is binary. If there's any translucent parts, then the alpha channel
# of the dest image will have its alpha channel modified. To prevent this:
# first use im.split() and take the third item which is the alpha channel and
# use that as the mask. Then take the image and use im.convert("RGB") to strip
# the image from its alpha channel, and use that as the source to paste()
