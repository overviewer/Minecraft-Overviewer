Cache_Lite is perfs oriented. So before commiting, please bench your patch !

To bench Cache_Lite, I use the tool 'ab' (distributed with apache).

(for example)
/usr/sbin/ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://127.0.0.1/ [...] /Cache_Lite/tests/bench.php

In the output of 'ab', most important things are :
- Failed requests: (must be 0 ! If not, don't commit !)
- Requests per second:    XXX [#/sec] (mean)


For testing if the cache is ok or not, you can use the script 'test.php', it 
will write if the cache has been hit or missed...
