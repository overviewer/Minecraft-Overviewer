"A filter function is a python function that is used to figure out if a "
"given POI should be part of a markerSet or not, and to control how it is "
"displayed. The function should accept one argument (a dictionary, also "
"know as an associative array), and return a string representing the text "
"to be displayed.  For example::"
msgstr ""

"This example is intended as a teaching aid and does not escape HTML, so "
"if you are concerned that your Minecraft players will put HTML/JS into "
"their signs, see below for a version that does do escaping."

"If a POI doesn't match, the filter can return None (which is the default "
"if a python functions runs off the end without an explicit 'return')."

"The single argument will either a TileEntity, or an Entity taken directly"

"player's location or a player's spawn.  See below for more details."

"In this example, this function returns all 4 lines from the sign if the "

"Additionally, you can filter based on other Block Entity data by "
