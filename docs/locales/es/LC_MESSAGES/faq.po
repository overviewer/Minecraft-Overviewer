msgid "Does the Overviewer work with mod blocks?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:14
msgid ""
"The Overviewer will render the world, but none of the blocks added by "
"mods will be visible. Currently, the blocks Overviewer supports are "
"hardcoded, and because there is no official Minecraft modding API as of "
"the time of writing, supporting mod blocks is not trivial."

msgid "Can I view Overviewer maps without having an internet connection?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:22
msgid ""
"Yes, absolutely. The Overviewer switched away from the Google Maps API "
"and now uses Leaflet. All files which Overviewer needs are included in "
"the output, so even if you have no internet connection, you will still be"
" able to view the map without any issues."

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:30
msgid ""
"When your map expands (\"Your map seems to have expanded beyond its "
"previous bounds\") you may see tiles at a zoom level that shouldn't be "
"there, usually around the borders. This is probably not a bug, but is "
"typically caused by copying the map tiles from their render destination "
"to another location (such as a web server)."

"Explanation: When Overviewer re-arranges tiles to make room for another "
"zoom level, it moves some tiles at a particular zoom level and places "
"them at a higher zoom level. The tiles that used to be at that zoom level"
" should no longer exist there, but if you're copying tiles, there is no "
"mechanism to *delete* those files at the copy destination."

"Often with servers one user will travel reeeeally far out and cause a lot"
" of extra work for the server and for The Overviewer, so you may be "
"tempted to delete parts of your map. This can cause problems, so read on "
"to learn what you can do about it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:137
msgid ""
"First some explanation: Until recently (Mid May 2012) The Overviewer did "
"not have any facility for detecting parts of the map that should no "
"longer exist. Remember that the map is split into small tiles. When "
"Overviewer starts up, the first thing it does is calculate which tiles "
"should exist and which should be updated. This means it does not check or"
" even look at tiles that should not exist. This means that parts of your "
"world which have been deleted will hang around on your map because "
"Overviewer won't even look at those tiles and notice they shouldn't be "
"there. You may even see strange artifacts around the border as tiles that"
" should exist get updated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:147
msgid ""
"Now, with the :option:`--check-tiles` option, The Overviewer *will* look "
"for and remove tiles that should no longer exist. So you can render your "
"map once with that option and all those extra tiles will get removed "
"automatically. However, this is only half of the solution. The other half"
" is making sure the tiles along the border are re-rendered, or else it "
"will look like your map is being cut off."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:153
msgid ""
"Explanation: The tiles next to the ones that were removed are tiles that "
"should continue to exist, but parts of them have chunks that no longer "
"exist. Those tiles then should be re-rendered to show that. However, "
"since tile updates are triggered by the chunk last-modified timestamp "
"changing, and the chunks that still exist have *not* been updated, those "
"tiles will not get re-rendered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:159
msgid ""
"The consequence of this is that your map will end up looking cut-off "
"around the new borders that were created by the parts you deleted. You "
"can fix this one of two ways."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:163
msgid ""
"You can run a render with :option:`--forcerender`. This has the "
"unfortunate side-effect of re-rendering *everything* and doing much more "
"work than is necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:167
msgid ""
"Manually navigate the tile directory hierarchy and manually delete tiles "
"along the edge. Then run once again with :option:`--check-tiles` to re-"
"render the tiles you just deleted. This may not be as bad as it seems. "
"Remember each zoom level divides the world into 4 quadrants: 0, 1, 2, and"
" 3 are the upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right. It "
"shouldn't be too hard to navigate it manually to find the parts of the "
"map that need re-generating."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:174
msgid ""
"The third non-option is to not worry about it. The problem will fix "
"itself if people explore near there, because that will force that part of"
" the map to update."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:179
msgid "My map is zoomed out so far that it looks (almost) blank."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:181
msgid ""
"We see this quite a bit, and seems to stem from a bug in the Minecraft "
"terrain generation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:184
msgid ""
"Explanation: Minecraft generates chunks of your world as it needs them. "
"When Overviewer goes to render your map, it looks at how big the world "
"is, and calculates how big the maps needs to be in order to fit it all "
"in. Occasionally, we see that Minecraft has generated a few chunks of the"
" world extremely far away from the main part of the world. These "
"erroneous chunks have most likely not been explored [*]_ and should not "
"exist."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:191
msgid ""
"There are two solutions. The preferred is to delete the offending chunks."
" Open up your region folder of your world and look at the region file "
"names. They are numbered ``r.##.##.mcr`` where ``##`` is a number. The "
"two numbers indicate the coordinates of that region file. Look for region"
" files with coordinates much larger in magnitude than any others. Most "
"likely you will find around 1–3 region files with coordinates much larger"
" than any others. Delete or otherwise remove those files, and re-render "
"your map."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/faq.rst:199
msgid ""
"The other option is to use the :ref:`crop<crop>` option to tell "
"Overviewer not to render all of your map, but instead to only render the "
"specified region."

"coordinates were typed in manually."

"I want to put manual POI definitions or other parts of my config into a "
"separate file."

"This can be achieved by creating a module and then importing it in your "
"config.  First, create a file containing your markers definitions. We'll "
"call it ``manualmarkers.py``."
