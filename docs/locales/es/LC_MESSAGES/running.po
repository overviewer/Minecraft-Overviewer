"Overviewer is a command-line application, and so it needs to be run from "
"the command line. If you installed Overviewer from a package manager, the"
" command is ``overviewer.py``. If you downloaded it manually, open a "
"terminal window and navigate to wherever you downloaded Overviewer. For "
"pre-compiled Windows builds, the command is ``overviewer.exe``. For other"
" systems, it's ``overviewer.py``."

"The first form is for basic or quick renderings without having to create "

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:92
msgid ""
"The second, preferred usage involves creating a configuration file which "

msgid "Options"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:113
msgid ""
"The following options change the way The Overviewer generates or updates "
"the map, and are intended to be things you only have to use in special "
"situations. You should not normally have to specify these options; the "
"default is typically correct."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:120
msgid ""
"With this option, The Overviewer will determine which tiles to render by "
"looking at the saved last-render timestamp and comparing it to the last-"
"modified time of the chunks of the world. It builds a tree of tiles that "
"need updating and renders only those tiles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:125
msgid ""
"This option does not do *any* checking of tile mtimes on disk, and thus "
"is the cheapest option: only rendering what needs updating while "
"minimising disk IO."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:129
msgid ""
"The caveat is that the *only* thing to trigger a tile update is if "
"Minecraft updates a chunk. Any other reason a tile may have for needing "
"re-rendering is not detected. This means that changes in your render "
"configuration will not be reflected in your world except in updated "
"chunks. It could also cause problems if the system clock of the machine "
"running Minecraft is not stable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:135
msgid ""
"**This option is the default** unless :option:`--forcerender` or :option"
":`--check-tiles` is in effect.  This option conflicts with "
":option:`--forcerender` and :option:`--check-tiles`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:141
msgid ""
"Forces The Overviewer to check each tile on disk and check to make sure "
"it is up to date. This also checks for tiles that shouldn't exist and "
"deletes them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:145
msgid ""
"This is functionally equivalent to :option:`--no-tile-checks` with the "
"difference that each tile is individually checked. It is therefore useful"
" if the tiles are not consistent with the last-render timestamp that is "
"automatically stored. This option was designed to handle the case where "
"the last render was interrupted -- some tiles have been updated but "
"others haven't, so each one is checked before it is rendered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:152
msgid ""
"This is slightly slower than :option:`--no-tile-checks` due to the "
"additional disk-io involved in reading tile mtimes from the filesystem"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:155
msgid ""
"Since this option also checks for erroneous tiles, **It is also useful "
"after you delete sections of your map, e.g. with worldedit, to delete "
"tiles that should no longer exist.** Overviewer greatly overestimates "
"tiles to be rendered and time needed to complete."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:160
msgid ""
"The caveats with this option are the same as for :option:`--no-tile-"
"checks` with the additional caveat that tile timestamps in the filesystem"
" must be preserved. If you copy tiles or make changes to them with an "
"external tool that modifies mtimes of tiles, it could cause problems with"
" this option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:165

"This option is automatically activated when The Overviewer detects the "
"last render was interrupted midway through. This option conflicts with "
":option:`--forcerender` and :option:`--no-tile-checks`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:171
msgid ""
"Forces The Overviewer to re-render every tile regardless of whether it "
"thinks it needs updating or not. It does no tile mtime checks, and "
"therefore ignores the last render time of the world, the last "
"modification times of each chunk, and the filesystem mtimes of each tile."
" It unconditionally renders every tile that exists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/running.rst:177
msgid ""
"The caveat with this option is that it does *no* checks, period. Meaning "
"it will not detect tiles that do exist, but shouldn't (this can happen if"
" your world shrinks for some reason. For that specific case, :option"
":`--check-tiles` is actually the appropriate mode)."

"files, causing Overviewer to re-render the entire map. To copy files on "
"Unix, while keeping these modification times intact, use ``cp -p``. For "
"people who render from backups, GNU ``tar`` automatically handles "
"modification times correctly. ``rsync -a --delete`` will handle this "
"correctly as well. If you use some other tool, you'll have to figure out "
