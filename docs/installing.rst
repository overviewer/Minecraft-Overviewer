Installing
==========

This page is for installing the pre-compiled binary versions of the Overviewer.
If you want to build the Overviewer from source yourself, head to :doc:`Building
<building>`. If you have already built The Overviewer, proceed to
:doc:`running`.

The latest prebuilt packages for various systems will always be found
at the `Overviewer Downloads <https://overviewer.org/downloads>`_ page.


Windows
=======
Running Windows and don't want to compile the Overviewer? You've come to the
right place!

1. Head to the `Downloads <https://overviewer.org/downloads>`_ page and download the most recent Windows download for your architecture (32 or 64 bit).

2. For 32 bit you may need to install the `VC++ 2008 (x86) <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf>`_ and `VC++ 2010 (x86) <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84>`_ redistributables.

   For 64 bit, you'll want these instead: `VC++ 2008 (x64) <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=bd2a6171-e2d6-4230-b809-9a8d7548c1b6>`_ and `VC++ 2010 (x64) <http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=14632>`_

3. That's it! Proceed with instructions on :doc:`running`.

Debian / Ubuntu
===============
We provide an APT repository with pre-built Overviewer packages for
Debian and Ubuntu users. To do this, run

::

    echo "deb https://overviewer.org/debian ./" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/minecraft-overviewer.list

Note that you will need to have the ``apt-transport-https`` package installed
for this source to work.

Our APT repository is signed. To install the key (and allow for
automatic updates), run

::

    wget -O - https://overviewer.org/debian/overviewer.gpg.asc | sudo apt-key add -

Then run ``apt-get update`` and ``apt-get install minecraft-overviewer`` and
you're all set! See you at the :doc:`running` page!

CentOS / RHEL / Fedora
======================
Prerequisites for CentOS/RHEL 7
--------------------------
Enable EPEL to get a release of Python 3::

    yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

The `official instructions <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ also recommend enabling a few
additional repositories, as some EPEL packages may depend on them. **However, this is only relevant
if you are not using CentOS**::

    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"


Installing the Overviewer
-------------------------
We provide a RPM repository with pre-built packages for users on RPM-based
distros. To add the Overviewer repository to YUM, just run

::

    wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/overviewer.repo https://overviewer.org/rpms/overviewer.repo

Then to install Overviewer run

::

    yum install Minecraft-Overviewer

After that head to the :doc:`running` page!
