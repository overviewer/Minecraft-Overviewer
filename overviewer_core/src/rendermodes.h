/* To make a new render primitive:
 *
 *  * add a new class to rendermodes.py
 *        there are a ton of examples there, the syntax is pretty simple. If
 *        you need any extra objects that are easy to create in python, this
 *        is where you put them.
 *
 *  * create a file in src/primitives with the same name
 *        so, Nether (named "nether") goes in `nether.c`.
 *
 *  * declare a RenderPrimitiveInterface with the name primitive_name
 *        if you have an underscore in the name, replace it with a
 *        hyphen. height-fading uses primitive_height_fading.
 *
 *  * fill in the entries of this struct
 *        the name should match, and you should declare an 'instance' struct
 *        to use as the self argument to each function. See nether.c and
 *        height-fading.c for simple examples.
 *
 * setup.py will pick up your primitive, add it to the global list, and build
 * it for you if you follow these conventions.

/* A quick note about the difference between occluded and hidden:
 *
 * Occluded should be used to tell the renderer that a block will not be
 * visible in the final image because other blocks will be drawn on top of
 * it. This is a potentially *expensive* check that should be used rarely,
 * usually only once per block. The idea is this check is expensive, but not
 * as expensive as drawing the block itself.
 *
 * Hidden is used to tell the renderer not to draw the block, usually because
 * the current rendermode depends on those blocks being hidden to do its
 * job. For example, cave mode uses this to hide non-cave blocks. This check
 * should be *cheap*, as it's potentially called many times per block. For
 * example, in lighting mode it is called at most 4 times per block.
