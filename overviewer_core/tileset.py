"""

tileset.py contains the TileSet class, and in general, routines that manage a
set of output tiles corresponding to a requested rendermode for a world. In
general, there will be one TileSet object per world per rendermode requested by
the user.

The TileSet class implements the Worker interface. This interface has the
following methods:

do_preprocessing()
    This method is called before iterate_work_items(). It should do any work
    that needs to be done prior to iterate_work_items(). It is not called for
    instances that will not have iterate_work_items() called.

get_num_phases()
    This method returns an integer indicating how many phases of work this
    worker has to perform. Each phase of work is completed serially with the
    other phases... all work done by one phase is done before the next phase is
    started.

get_phase_length(phase)
    This method returns an integer indicating how many work items there are in
    this phase. This number is used for purely informational purposes. It can
    be exact, or an estimate. If there is no useful information on the size of
    a phase, return None.

iterate_work_items(phase)
    Takes a phase number (a non-negative integer). This method should return an
    iterator over work items and a list of dependencies i.e. (work_item, [d1,
    d2, ...]). The work items and dependencies can be any pickelable object;
    they are treated as opaque by the Dispatcher. The work item objects are
    passed back in to the do_work() method (perhaps in a different, identically
    configured instance).

    The dependency items are other work items that are compared for equality
    with work items that are already in the queue. The dispatcher guarantees
    that dependent items which are currently in the queue or in progress finish
    before the corresponding work item is started. Note that dependencies must
    have already been yielded as work items before they can be used as
    dependencies; the dispatcher requires this ordering or it cannot guarantee
    the dependencies are met.

do_work(workobj)
    Does the work for a given work object. This method is not expected to
    return anything, so the results of its work should be reflected on the
    filesystem or by sending signals.

# small but useful
def iterate_base4(d):
    """Iterates over a base 4 number with d digits"""
    return product(xrange(4), repeat=d)

# A named tuple class storing the row and column bounds for the to-be-rendered
# world
Bounds = namedtuple("Bounds", ("mincol", "maxcol", "minrow", "maxrow"))

# A note about the implementation of the different rendercheck modes:
#
# For reference, here's what the rendercheck modes are:
#   0
#       Only render tiles that have chunks with a greater mtime than the last
#       render timestamp, and their ancestors.
#
#       In other words, only renders parts of the map that have changed since
#       last render, nothing more, nothing less.
#
#       This is the fastest option, but will not detect tiles that have e.g.
#       been deleted from the directory tree, or pick up where a partial
#       interrupted render left off.

#   1
#       For render-tiles, render all whose chunks have an mtime greater than
#       the mtime of the tile on disk, and their composite-tile ancestors.
#
#       Also check all other composite-tiles and render any that have children
#       with more rencent mtimes than itself.
#
#       This is slower due to stat calls to determine tile mtimes, but safe if
#       the last render was interrupted.

#   2
#       Render all tiles unconditionally. This is a "forcerender" and is the
#       slowest, but SHOULD be specified if this is the first render because
#       the scan will forgo tile stat calls. It's also useful for changing
#       texture packs or other options that effect the output.
#
# For 0 our caller has explicitly requested not to check mtimes on disk to
# speed things up. So the mode 0 chunk scan only looks at chunk mtimes and the
# last render mtime from the asset manager, and marks only the tiles that need
# rendering based on that.  Mode 0 then iterates over all dirty render-tiles
# and composite-tiles that depend on them. It does not check mtimes of any
# tiles on disk, so this is only a good option if the last render was not
# interrupted.

# For mode 2, this is a forcerender, the caller has requested we render
# everything. The mode 2 chunk scan marks every tile as needing rendering, and
# disregards mtimes completely. Mode 2 then iterates over all render-tiles and
# composite-tiles that depend on them, which is every tile. It therefore
# renders everything.

# In both 0 and 2 the render iteration is the same: the dirtytile tree built is
# authoritive on every tile that needs rendering.

# In mode 1, things are most complicated. Mode 1 chunk scan is identical to a
# forcerender, or mode 2 scan: every render tile that should exist is marked in
# the dirtytile tree. But instead of iterating over that tree directly, a
# special recursive algorithm goes through and checks every tile that should
# exist and determines whether it needs rendering. This routine works in such a
# way so that every tile is stat()'d at most once, so it shouldn't be too bad.
# This logic happens in the iterate_work_items() method, and therefore in the
# master process, not the worker processes.

# In all three rendercheck modes, the results out of iterate_work_items() is
# authoritive on what needs rendering. The do_work() method does not need to do
# any additional checks.

    def __init__(self, worldobj, regionsetobj, assetmanagerobj, texturesobj, options, outputdir):
        """Construct a new TileSet object with the given configuration options
        dictionary.

        options is a dictionary of configuration parameters (strings mapping to
        values) that are interpreted by the rendering engine.
        
        worldobj is the World object that regionsetobj is from.

        regionsetobj is the RegionSet object that is used to render the tiles.

        assetmanagerobj is the AssetManager object that represents the
        destination directory where we'll put our tiles.

        texturesobj is the Textures object to pass into the rendering routine.
        This class does nothing with it except pass it through.

        outputdir is the absolute path to the tile output directory where the
        tiles are saved. It is created if it doesn't exist

        Current valid options for the options dictionary are shown below. All
        the options must be specified unless they are not relevant. If the
        given options do not conform to the specifications, behavior is
        undefined (this class does not do any error checking and assumes items
        are given in the correct form).

        bgcolor
            A hex string specifying the background color for jpeg output.
            e.g.: "#1A1A1A". Not relevant unless rendering jpeg.

        renderchecks
            An integer indicating how to determine which tiles need updating
            and which don't. This key is optional; if not specified, an
            appropriate mode is determined from the persistent config obtained
            from the asset manager. This is one of three levels:

            0
                Only render tiles that have chunks with a greater mtime than
                the last render timestamp, and their ancestors.

                In other words, only renders parts of the map that have changed
                since last render, nothing more, nothing less.

                This is the fastest option, but will not detect tiles that have
                e.g. been deleted from the directory tree, or pick up where a
                partial interrupted render left off.

            1
                "check-tiles" mode. For render-tiles, render all whose chunks
                have an mtime greater than the mtime of the tile on disk, and
                their upper-tile ancestors.

                Also check all other upper-tiles and render any that have
                children with more rencent mtimes than itself.

                Also remove tiles and directory trees that do exist but
                shouldn't.

                This is slower due to stat calls to determine tile mtimes, but
                safe if the last render was interrupted.

            2
                Render all tiles unconditionally. This is a "forcerender" and
                is the slowest, but SHOULD be specified if this is the first
                render because the scan will forgo tile stat calls. It's also
                useful for changing texture packs or other options that effect
                the output.

        imgformat
            A string indicating the output format. Must be one of 'png' or
            'jpeg'

        imgquality
            An integer 1-100 indicating the quality of the jpeg output. Only
            relevant in jpeg mode.

        optimizeimg
            an integer indiating optimizations to perform on png outputs. 0
            indicates no optimizations. Only relevant in png mode.
            1 indicates pngcrush is run on all output images
            2 indicates pngcrush and advdef are run on all output images with advdef -z2
            3 indicates pngcrush and advdef are run on all output images with advdef -z4

        rendermode
            Perhaps the most important/relevant option: a string indicating the
            render mode to render. This rendermode must have already been
            registered with the C extension module.

        rerenderprob
            A floating point number between 0 and 1 indicating the probability
            that a tile which is not marked for render by any mtime checks will
            be rendered anyways. 0 disables this option.

        changelist
            Optional: A file descriptor which will be opened and used as the
            changelist output: each tile written will get outputted to the
            specified fd.

        Other options that must be specified but aren't really documented
        (oops. consider it a TODO):
